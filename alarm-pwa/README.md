## Troubleshooting

### App Not Installing
- Make sure you're using HTTPS or localhost
- Check that all icon files are present
- Verify the manifest.json is accessible

### Alarms Not Working
- Grant notification permissions
- Keep the browser tab open or install as PWA
- Check that the device isn't in Do Not Disturb mode

### No Sound
- Check device volume
- Ensure the browser allows audio autoplay
- Try different sound options

### Background Issues
- Install as PWA for better background functionality
- Some browsers limit background tasks for regular web pages
- On iOS, background functionality is limited

## Browser Compatibility

- **Chrome/Edge**: Full support
- **Firefox**: Good support (limited background sync)
- **Safari**: Good support (limited background sync)
- **Mobile browsers**: Vary by platform

## Limitations

### PWA Limitations (vs Native Apps)
- Background execution is limited
- Some browsers restrict background alarms
- iOS has stricter PWA limitations
- Audio playback restrictions on some devices

### Workarounds
- Install as PWA for better performance
- Keep browser tab open for guaranteed functionality
- Use alongside device's native alarm as backup

## Development Notes

### Key Components
- **AlarmApp Class**: Main application logic
- **Service Worker**: Background functionality and caching
- **Local Storage**: Persistent alarm data
- **Web Audio API**: Sound generation
- **Notification API**: Push notifications

### Customization
- Modify colors in CSS variables
- Add new sound types in the `sounds` object
- Adjust snooze duration in `snoozeAlarm()` function
- Change notification settings in service worker

## Production Deployment

### 1. Web Server
Upload all files to any web server with HTTPS support:
- Netlify (free)
- Vercel (free)
- GitHub Pages (free)
- Your own web hosting

### 2. HTTPS Required
PWA features require HTTPS. Most hosting services provide this automatically.

### 3. Domain Setup
For best results, use a custom domain for easier sharing and bookmarking.

## Support

This is a complete, production-ready alarm app. The code is well-documented and follows modern web development practices.

### Common Issues
1. **Icons missing**: Icons are now included as SVG files - check that all files were extracted correctly
2. **Permissions denied**: Refresh page and grant permissions
3. **Not installing**: Ensure HTTPS and all files are present
4. **Background issues**: Install as PWA for better functionality

### Future Enhancements
- Add more sound options
- Implement recurring alarm patterns
- Add weather integration
- Multiple timezones support
- Custom alarm tones

**Note**: This PWA provides the best possible alarm functionality within web browser limitations. For critical alarms, consider using alongside your device's native alarm app as a backup.
